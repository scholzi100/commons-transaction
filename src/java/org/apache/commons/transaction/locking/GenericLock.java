/**
 * 
 * A generic implementaion of a simple multi level lock. 
 * 
 * <p>The idea is to have an ascending number of
 * lock levels ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>maxLockLevel</code> as specified in 
 * {@link #GenericLock(Object, int, LoggerFacade)}: the higher the lock level the stronger and more restrictive the lock. To determine which lock may coexist with other locks you have to imagine matching pairs of lock levels.
 * For each pair both parts allow for all lock levels less than or equal to the matching other part. Pairs are composed by the lowest and highest level not yet part of a pair and successively applying this 
 * method until no lock level is left. For an even amount of levels each level is part of exactly one pair.
 * For an odd amount the middle level is paired with itself. The highst lock level may coexist with the lowest one (<code>0</code>) which by definition means 
 * <code>NO LOCK</code>. This implies that you will have to specify at least one other lock level and thus 
 * set <code>maxLockLevel</code> to at least <code>1</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Although this may sound complicated, in practice this is quite simple. Let us imagine you have three lock levels:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>0</code>: <code>NO LOCK</code> (always needed by the
 * implementation of this lock)
 * <li><code>1</code>: <code>SHARED</code>
 * <li><code>2</code>: <code>EXCLUSIVE</code>
 * </ul>
 * Accordingly, you will have to set <code>maxLockLevel</code> to <code>2</code>.
 * Now, there are two pairs of levels
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>NO LOCK</code> with <code>EXCLUSIVE</code>
 * <li><code>SHARED</code> with <code>SHARED</code>
 * </ul>
 * This means when the current highest lock level is
 * <code>NO LOCK</code> everything less or equal to
 * <code>EXCLUSIVE</code> is allowed - which means every other lock
 * level. On the other side <code>EXCLUSIVE</code> allows exacly for
 * <code>NO LOCK</code> - which means nothing else. In conclusion,
 * <code>SHARED</code> allows for <code>SHARED</code> or <code>NO
 * LOCK</code>, but not for <code>EXCLUSIVE</code>. To make this very
 * clear have a look at this table, where <code>o</code> means
 * compatible or can coexist and <code>x</code> means incompatible or can
 * not coexist:</p>
 * <table>
 *   <tbody>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td align="center"></td>
 *       <td align="center">NO LOCK</td>
 *       <td align="center">SHARED</td><td align="center">EXCLUSIVE</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr><td align="center">NO LOCK</td><td align="center">o</td><td align="center">o</td><td align="center">o</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr><td align="center">SHARED</td><td align="center">o</td><td align="center">o</td><td align="center">x</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr><td align="center">EXCLUSIVE</td><td align="center" align="center">o</td><td align="center">x</td><td align="center">x</td>
 *     </tr>
 *   </tbody>
 * </table>
 * 
 * </p> 
 * 
 * General limitations include:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>You are restricted to the scheme described above
 * <li>There are no preferences configurable for lock levels. This means whenever more than
 * one party waits for a lock you can not specify which one is to be preferred. Under certain circumstances
 * I might be nice to have the opportunity to give priority to parties either applying for 
 * higher or lower lock levels. It might even be desirable not only to give priority to higher or lower locks,
 * but to a special level. For example you do not want to prefer higher lock levels, but exactly lock 
 * level <code>3</code> which might stand for <code>WRITE</code> access.
 * <li>It is not possible to represent hierarchical locks, i.e. locks having descendants
 * that are locked whenever the lock itself is locked. Consequently, there also is no notion
 * of an intention lock.
 * <li>You can not specify a timeframe for the validity of a lock. This means an owner of a thread
 * can never lose a lock except when <em>actively</em> releasing it. This is bad when an owner either
 * forgets to release a lock or is not able to do so due to error states or abnormal termination.  
 * </ul>
