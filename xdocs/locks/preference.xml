<section name="Preference Locks">

<p><em>Note: </em>Before reading further be sure to read the <a
href="tutorial.html">introductory tutorial.</a></p>


<p>With the new <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/MultiLevelLock2.html">lock</a> and its <a
href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/GenericLock.html">implementation</a>
introduced in version 1.1 there now is the possibility to prefer
certain lock request. If a lock is not directly available
a preferred lock request will be fulfilled before any other request
that is not preferred.</p> 

<p>Putting preferences on certain lock levels is what the <a
href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/ReadWriteLockManager.html">read/write
lock manager</a> and the <a
href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/ReadWriteUpgradeLockManager.html">read/write/upgrade
lock manager</a> with their respective implementations for <a
href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/ReadWriteLock.html">read/write</a>
and <a
href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/ReadWriteUpgradeLock.html">upgrade</a>
locks do.</p>

<p>For full flexibility there is an option to specify preference for any
locking request both in the <a
href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/LockManager2.html#lock(java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object,%20int,%20int,%20boolean,%20long)">lock
manager</a> as well as in the <a
href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/transaction/locking/MultiLevelLock2.html#acquire(java.lang.Object,%20int,%20boolean,%20int,%20boolean,%20long)">lock</a>.</p>
