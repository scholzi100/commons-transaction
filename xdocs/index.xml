<section name="The Transaction Component">
<p>Commons Transaction aims at providing lightweight, standardized,
well tested and 
efficient implementations of utility classes commonly used in
transactional Java programming. Initially there are implementations for
multi level locks, 
transactional collections and transactional file access. There may
be additional implementations when the common need for them becomes
obvious. However, the complete component shall remain compatible to
JDK1.2 and should have minimal dependencies.</p>
<p>The optimal - but maybe impudent - long term goal would be to create the transactional counterpart
of <a
href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">Doug
Lea's fabulous concurrent package</a> which recently made it to Java 5.0.</p> 


<p>These are the initial parts in detail:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="maps/index.html">memory</a> package:</b>
Contains a wrapper to make any map implementing interface
<code>java.util.Map</code> transactional. 

Depending on the type of the map that is wrapped this can either work as a
transactional cache or some sort of volatile memory store.
</li>

<li>
<b><a href="locks/index.html">locking</a> package:</b>
Interfaces and implementations for locks that can have more than one
owner at different compatible levels.
</li>

<li>
<b><a href="file/index.html">file</a> package:</b>
Implementation of transaction file access. Using a pessimistic
locking schema this implementation features
<em>serializable</em> transactions. 
</li>

<li>
<b><em>util</em> package:</b> 
Contains a collection of utility classes used by the transaction
package itself. Of more general interest could be a rendezvous barrier
and a file utility class.
</li>
</ul>
